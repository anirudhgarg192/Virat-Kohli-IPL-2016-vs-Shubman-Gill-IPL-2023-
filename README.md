# Virat-Kohli-IPL-2016-vs-Shubman-Gill-IPL-2023-
This analytical model compares Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill's performances in IPL 2016 and IPL 2023 respectively. While the former struck 973 runs in 2016, the latter hit 890 runs in 2023. However, just runs cannot be used to compare any two batting performances. Hence, I have used multiple parameters to compare the two modern day greats.

The parameters that have been considered to compare their performances are:
1) Strike rates by phases
2) Ratios of their strike rates when compared with that of other batter's
3) Ratios of their strike rates when compared with that of other batter's - by phases
4) Strike rates against top three wicket takers of their respective seasons
5) Percentage of team's runs scored
6) Dot balls percentage
7) Mean runs scored in different innings
8) Ratios of their strike rates when compared with that of other batter's - at home
9) Mean runs scored at home


Understanding the key parameters used in the model:

Parameters (2), (3) and (8) play a very important role in this analysis. The batting standards, definitions of a par score and the kind of pitches used have changed drastically since 2016 and it is important to compare the players' strike rates with their peers from their respective seasons.

Parameter (4) is a very interesting base for comparison. If a batter can counter attack the opposition's best bowler, then he automatically creates a pressure on the rest of the team. Hence, as absurd as this parameter may sound, it is a very good base to compare the two performances. Also, it tells about the kind of impact the batter's innings has on the game and on the opposition's strategies.

Parameter (5) gives an indication about the batter's contribution to the team's success with the bat.

Parameter (6) shows us how the batter avoids the pressure built by playing too many dot balls. The lower the percentage, the better are his abilities to rotate the strike and unsettle the bowler from his gameplan.

Parameter (7) indicates how the batter performed under different situations - while setting a target and while approaching a chase.

Parameter (8) is again very important. While Virat Kohli played nine games in M. Chinnaswami Stadium, Shubman Gill played same number of games in Narendra Modi Stadium. Both the grounds offered the best of the batting conditions and not just them, other batters too had the same advantage. Thus, it is necessary to compare their strike rates with the rest of batters who batted (combined) in those stadiums.

Also, I have not considered their averages. Rather, I have calculated the mean runs they scored in the season, ie. runs per innings, because averages are bound to be hampered by undismissed innings.
